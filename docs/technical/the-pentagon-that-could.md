# The Pentagon That Could

It is a commonly known result that the regular pentagon cannot tile a 2D plane. This is in contrast to regular triangles, squares and hexagons, which do. However, it has been shown by [Hirschhorn and Hunt](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82754854.pdf), that many pentagonal tilings do exist, provided the pentagon is irregular, but equilateral. In other words, the lengths of the five sides are equal, but the angles are different.

## Rotational symmetry

Of particular interest for the purposes of A5, is a pentagonal tiling which has a five-fold rotational symmetry. As shown in the aforementioned paper, such a tiling must have two non-adjacent angles 72° and 108°. With these fixed, all the other angles can be deduced from the fact that the sides are equilateral, as this [example](/examples/pentagon) demonstrates.

## Constructing a lattice

By tiling this pentagon, a [lattice](/examples/lattice) is generated. As the size of the lattice grows the overall shape tends toward that of an isosceles triangle, with a vertex angle of 72°. By duplicating this tiling five times and rotating appropriately, a tiling is formed which has the shape of a regular pentagon. 

The [lattice can be explored in this example](/examples/lattice).
