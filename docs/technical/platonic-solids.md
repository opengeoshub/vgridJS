# Platonic Solids

In order to create a uniform grid of cells that covers the globe at different resolutions, the A5 system uses at each level:

- A **solid**, which is the 3D shape of the whole grid,
- A **primitive**, which is the shape of the cell used to construct the **solid**.

The **primitives** form a logical hierarchy, in that each primitive at a resolution level *r + 1*, has a parent primitive in the resolution level above it, *r*.

Note this hierarchy is purely logical, in general a primitive does not split geometrically into its children exactly. There is a high level of spatial coherence though, with children being co-located with their parents.

## Resolution 0

The first resolution level is simply the entire globe, with a **single cell**. Thus the **primitive** is a *sphere* and the **solid** is also a *sphere*.

## Resolution 1

For resolution 1, the globe is divided into **12 cells**, with a [*regular pentagon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon) as the **primitive**. Together, these form a **solid** [*regular dodecahedron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_dodecahedron), which is a [Platonic solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid).

The *regular dodecahedron* is the **Platonic solid** that most closely approximates a sphere, as it has the lowest [angular defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_defect) at its vertices. It is this property that allows [A5](https://a5geo.org/) to minimize the variation in cell size at all resolution levels.

## Resolution 2

The next resolution level subdivides each *regular pentagon* **primitive** into 5 [*icosceles triangles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle) - yielding a total of **60 quintants**. Together these form a **solid** [*pentakis dodecahedron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentakis_dodecahedron). For clarity, the term **quintant** is used to refer to this primitive, as it forms a fifth of the pentagonal dodecahedron face.

## Resolution 3

For higher resolution levels it is necessary to sub-divide each **quintant** primitive into smaller cells. This is [achieved with a tiling](./the-pentagon-that-could) using an *irregular pentagon* as a **primitive**, where each additional resolution level **quadruples** the number of cells. Thus resolution **level 3** gives **240 cells**, **level 4** gives **960 cells** and so on.

These cells together form a **solid**, which as far as the author is aware, has not yet been described and will be refered to as a *teohedron*.

While all the preceding solids have primitives of exactly equal shapes and sizes, the *teohedron* can be thought of as a pseudo-Platonic solid, in that it is constructed from primitives of almost equal shape and area (the area varies by only ~2%).

## Resolution 4+

All higher resolution levels are generated by using an ever-finer tiling using the *irregular pentagon* as a primitive. Even though the tiling forms a jagged edge along each side of the *quintant*, these edges perfectly mesh into each other, resulting in complete and uninterrupted coverage of the globe.

Two higher order *teohedrons* are shown below, which correspond to resolution levels 4 and 5.

In principle there is no limit to the resolution of a *teohedron*, however the A5 tiling system only uses finite number of resolution levels in order to store the cell identifier as a 64-bit integer.
