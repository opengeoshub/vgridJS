This is in contrast to regular triangles, squares and hexagons, which do. However, it has been shown by Hirschhorn and Hunt, that many pentagonal tilings do exist, provided the pentagon is irregular, but equilateral. In other words, the lengths of the five sides are equal, but the angles are different.","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}}')}}]);
